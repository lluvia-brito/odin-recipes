    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A dessert that calls me back to my childhood and dusty Diners along old Route 66. A slice of this pie is pure nostalgia! A homemade flaky crust filled with smooth buttery lemon curd, topped with a light and fluffy meringue. A wonderful balance of tart and sweet flavors, smooth and crunchy textures.</p>
    <h2>Crust</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, very cold</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp. table salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup water with ice cubes</li>
        <li>Flour, for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Lemon Curd</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
        <li>5 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. finely grated lemon zest</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Meringue</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 egg whites</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. cream of tartar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>For the Crust:</strong> Whisk together flour, sugar, and salt. </li>
        <li>Dice the butter into 1/2 inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the butter cubes over the flour mixture and begin mixing with a pastry cutter. Stop when the butter pieces are the size of peas.</li>
        <li>Drizzle 1/2 cup of the ice water over the mixture. Use a silicon spatula to gather the dough together. Add more water if needed, 1 tbsp. at a time until you can gently knead into a ball.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough in half, package each ball in plastic wrap, let rest in the fridge for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400˚. Dust flour over your countertop before rolling out the dough to fit your pie pan. Tuck the edges of the crust under to be even with the edge of your dish and crimp. Line the inside of the crust with parchment paper, then fill with dried beans. Bake for 16 to 18 minutes, remove the beans and parchment paper. Return to the oven for 12 to 14 minutes, or until the whole crust is golden brown. Let cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li><strong>For the Lemon Curd:</strong> In a medium saucepan whisk together the sugar, cornstarch, flour, and salt. Gradually stir in 1 1/2 cups cold water until smooth.</li>
        <li>Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture boils, about 5 minutes. Boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly, then remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Whisk the egg yolks in a small bowl. While whisking, slowly add 1/4 cup of the hot mixture into the egg yolks. Gradually stir the yolk mixture from the bowl back into the remaining sugar mixture in the saucepan. Return to medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until a thermometer reads 160˚ to 180˚.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and immediately stir in the butter, lemon juice and zest, until the butter is completely melted. Pour the filling into the cooled pie crust. Let it cool for 15 minutes. Press a piece of plastic wrap onto the surface of the filling, then cool in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>For the Meringue:</strong> Place a medium saucepan filled with 1-inch of water over medium heat and bring to a simmer. In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together the egg whites, vanilla, sugar, salt, and cream of tartar. Place the mixing bowl over the simmering water and continue to mix, scraping the sides of the bowl frequently with a rubber spatula so that the egg whites don’t cook, until the sugar has dissolved into the egg whites, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the bowl to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and whisk on medium-high speed for 4 to 5 minutes, until the meringue is glossy and holds a medium-stiff peak. Dollop the meringue over top of the pie to completely cover the lemon filling and swirl with the back of a spoon to make decorative swoops and swirls.</li>
        <li>Toast the meringue with a kitchen torch or place under a broiler (about 8 inches from the broiler element heated to high heat) for 1 minute, until lightly toasted. Let cool completely to room temperature, then serve.</li>
