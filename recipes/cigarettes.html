    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fine cut, preferably an Amsterdam Shag, rolling tobacco.</li>
        <li>Your favorite rolling papers </li>
        <li>Saliva, but not too much</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove a single paper from the package. Nestle one edge of the paper carefully between your index finger, and thumb plus middle finger of your non-dominant hand.  </li>
        <li>With your dominant hand pull free a clump of tobacco from the pouch. Laying the clump onto the paper, use the index finer of your non-dominant hand to stabilze the clump while you form it into a rough skinny cylinder.</li>
        <li>Now you can use both of your index fingers to smooth out the tobacco. Then use your thumbs to roll up and down, tuck the paper once you are satisfied with the density of the tobacco.</li>
        <li>Lick the adhesive edge of the paper and roll applying even pressure to seal the cigarette.</li>
        <li>Look around the diner, ask the most interesting person you see for a light.</li>
    </ol>
